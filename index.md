In this program, the user can play a simple game. They will move around a 'player', which is initially placed at the top of the screen, and attempt to reach the floor as many times as possible. They must avoid the randomly flying triangles, which also obey a general acceleration due to gravity. At the end, the score is calculated using the number of hits on the floor as well as the time the user lasts.
This project uses concepts such as inheritance, overridden methods, abstract classes, and methods from the StdDraw class

# Ciphers project: 
https://github.com/rrai77/ciphers

When fully completed, this program will be able to encrypt and decrypt phrases using various ciphers, such as Morse Code, ROT13, ROT47, Caesar, etc. Currently, you can look through the abstract class, the runner class, and the Morse-code-specific subclass.
This project uses concepts such as inheritance, overridden methods, abstract classes, hashmaps, and arrays.
